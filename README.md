# My Very First Web Page

## Welcome!

This web page was created according to the full-stack development program with Code Institute. 
This is for educational purposes only and not intended for commercial use.

## Overview
This project lists many technologies in the software development industry and links their logos to their wikipedia pages for a full description of their backgrounds and functionalities.
By having these technologies listed in one area, I can easily read up on them and draw comparisons as and when.

## Features
* [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5) was used to render the website.
* [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/CSS3) was used to style the HTML website.
